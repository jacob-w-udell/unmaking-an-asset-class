# Unmaking An Asset Class

### Resources and writing on rental housing finance and landlord operations


We sometimes hear that housing is 'financialized' or 'commodified'. But what does that mean? And what impact should this have on our organizing, strategy, and politics? This site is about trying to explore those questions. As a start, I want to define housing today as a *global asset class*. 

See here (*link*) for a longer definition. But in short: by global, I mean that capital from around the country and the world now flows into local housing markets. By asset class, I mean that housing was made invest-able to that capital, such that investors felt like they can anticipate future changes in the value of housing, even from a distance. 

The development of housing as a global asset class is complex, but in sum, it led to *the steady and know-able rise in property values*, or at least mostly know-able cycles of booms and busts. We can trace that process back to at least the 1990s, if not much farther. 

Today, housing produces rising values more consistently and lucratively than just about an other financial asset, for both homeowners and landlords. And the system we've created treats the asset prices of housing as arguably more important than whether that housing is being used to provide safe, decent, and affordable homes. Or maybe a better way to say it is -- our system is willing to producing safe, decent, and affordable homes only to the extent that those things don't infringe on the role of housing as a financial asset, or on profit generally.

This is untenable, because housing as a home and housing as an asset are often very much at odds. And key to dealing with that contradiction is breaking with our economy's addiction to rising property values, or to treating housing as an asset class. That's not impossible, though we're often told it is. Housing as an global asset class was **made**, and any alternative vision requires that we **unmake it**. 

This site is focused on rental housing, though I hope to connect things to the lots of great work on the legacy of wealth-building through home-ownership, and on New York City & State, though I think it will be relevant elsewhere. It's divided into three different areas:

##### Guides (*link*) 
This section will include guides to key concepts in understanding housing finance, finance in general, and landlord operations.

##### Resources (*link*)
This section will mostly include links to other people's writing that I've found helpful in understanding this stuff, with some commentary by me.

##### Blog (*link*) 
This section will include shorter, less theoretical posts -- tracking individual buildings, landlords, or developments that I think are important.
