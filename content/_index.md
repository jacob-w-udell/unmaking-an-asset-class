# Unmaking An Asset Class

### Resources and writing on real estate finance and landlord operations, with a focus on NYC.

Real estate as an asset class was made (italicize this) -- homogenization of risk, rising property values etc etc ... any alternative vision requires that we **unmake it**.

Writings, resources, readings devoted to making that happen.
