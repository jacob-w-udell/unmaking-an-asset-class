### Resources and writing on rental housing finance and landlord operations

We sometimes hear that housing in our era is 'financialized' or 'commodified'. But what does that mean? And what impact should this have on our organizing, strategy, and politics? This site is about trying to explore those questions. As a start, I want to define housing today as a *global asset class* -- see here for a definition (*link*). 

In short -- Housing in our era produces rising values more consistently than just about an other financial asset, for homeowners and for landlords. And the system we've created treats the asset prices of housing as arguably more important than whether that housing is being used to provide safe, decent, and affordable homes. Or maybe a better way to say it is -- our system is willing to producing safe, decent, and affordable homes only to the extent that those things don't infringe on the role of housing as a financial asset (or on profit generally).

This is untenable, because housing as a home and housing as an asset are often very much at odds. And key to dealing with that contradiction is breaking with our economy's addiction to rising property values, or to treating housing as an asset class. That's not impossible, though we're often told it is. Housing as an invest-able asset class was *made* (and relatively recently at that). Any alternative vision requires that we *unmake it*.

This site is focused on rental housing, though I hope to connect things to the lots of great work on the legacy of wealth-building through homeownership, and on New York City & State, though I think will be relevant elsewhere. It's divided into three different areas:

##### Guides (*link*) 
This section will include guides to key concepts in understanding housing finance, finance in general, and landlord operations.

##### Resources (*link*)
This section will mostly include links to other people's writing that I've found helpful in understanding this stuff, with some commentary by me.

##### Blog (*link*) 
This section will include shorter, less theoretical posts -- tracking individual buildings, landlords, or developments that I think are important.


And if you're looking for places to start, try:

- Landlord Operations -- a quick guide (*link*)
- Bank Financing series (*links 1, 2, 3, 4, 5*)
