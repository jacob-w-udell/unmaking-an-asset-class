<h3 id="resources-and-writing-on-rental-housing-finance-and-landlord-operations">Resources and writing on rental housing finance and landlord operations</h3>
<p>We sometimes hear that housing is &lsquo;financialized&rsquo; or &lsquo;commodified&rsquo;. But what does that mean? And what impact should this have on our organizing, strategy, and politics? This site is about trying to explore those questions, with a focus less on development (the production of new housing) and more on the existing stock of housing. As a start, I want to define existing housing today as a <em>global asset class</em>.</p>
<p>See here (<em>link</em>) for a longer definition. But in short: by global, I mean that capital from around the country and the world now flows into local housing markets. By asset class, I mean that housing was made invest-able to that capital, such that investors felt like they can anticipate future changes in the value of housing, even from a distance.</p>
<p>The development of housing as a global asset class is complex, but in sum, it led to <em>the steady and know-able rise in property values</em>, or at least mostly know-able cycles of booms and busts. We can trace that process back to at least the 1990s, if not much farther.</p>
<p>Today, housing produces rising values more consistently and lucratively than just about an other financial asset, for both homeowners and landlords. And the system we&rsquo;ve created treats the asset prices of housing as arguably more important than whether that housing is being used to provide safe, decent, and affordable homes. Or maybe a better way to say it is &ndash; our system is willing to producing safe, decent, and affordable homes only to the extent that those things don&rsquo;t infringe on the role of housing as a financial asset, or on profit generally.</p>
<p>This is untenable, because housing as a home and housing as an asset are often very much at odds. And key to dealing with that contradiction is breaking with our economy&rsquo;s addiction to rising property values, or to treating housing as an asset class. That&rsquo;s not impossible, though we&rsquo;re often told it is. Housing as an global asset class was <strong>made</strong>, and any alternative vision requires that we <strong>unmake it</strong>.</p>
<p>This site is focused on rental housing, though I hope to connect things to the lots of great work on the legacy of wealth-building through home-ownership, and on New York City &amp; State, though I think it will be relevant elsewhere. It&rsquo;s divided into three different areas:</p>
<h5 id="guides-link">Guides (<em>link</em>)</h5>
<p>This section will include guides to key concepts in understanding housing finance, finance in general, and landlord operations.</p>
<h5 id="resources-link">Resources (<em>link</em>)</h5>
<p>This section will mostly include links to other people&rsquo;s writing that I&rsquo;ve found helpful in understanding this stuff, with some commentary by me.</p>
<h5 id="blog-link">Blog (<em>link</em>)</h5>
<p>This section will include shorter, less theoretical posts &ndash; tracking individual buildings, landlords, or developments that I think are important.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking for places to start, try:</p>
